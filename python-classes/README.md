# Python Classes
## How to define a class in python ?
In python a class is defined by the **class** key word followed by the **class name**

```class <classname>```

**Example:**

``` class Flights() ```

**NOTES:**
- By convention the class name uses CamelCase
- Python module file to hold our class definitions
- Empty blocks are not allowed ,so the simplest class block needs a do nothing pass statement.

### Methods
- Methods are functions defined within the class

### Instance methods

Instance methods are functions which can be called on objects.
